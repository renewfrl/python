# Challenge

* Use exercise21 as basis
* Extend the constructor in such a way that is possible to provide a streetname and housenumber at 
creation time of the class.
* Print again streetnumber and housenumber

The result should be then: h = House('tesselschade', 1)

## Hit:

* Make the variables private (__housenumber)

* a method signature looks like; `name(self, argument 1, 2)`

* use the __init__ to provide the variables
