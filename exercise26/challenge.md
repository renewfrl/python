# Challenge modules


* Create a module with a hello function which takes as a single argument a name (type: String)
and print "Hello <name>"

* Create a second file with a goodbye function which 
** calls first the hello function
** then prints "Goodbye"


The result should be then: 

```
hello rene
goodbuey
```

## Hit:

* Make sure that a module (directory) always contains the `__init__.py` file (empty)
* FROM <module> import <...>

```
